## WHAT IT CREATES (YEARNING)

**User Experience:**
```
User: "Analyze this codebase"
SHIM: ✅ Found 15 code smells, 3 anti-patterns

SHIM: "This file has 1200 lines, frequent queries → Suggest JSON index"
SHIM: "Mocks detected → Propose proper implementation"
SHIM: "Building queue system → Search for existing tools first (LEAN-OUT)"

User thinks: "This is incredible. But I need DEEP analysis across ALL repos."
→ Discovers Eye of Sauron / GREGORE
```

**The Funnel:**
SHIM (free code quality) → User wants enterprise-level analysis → Eye of Sauron/GREGORE (paid)
