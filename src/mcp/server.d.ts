 * Provides invisible background infrastructure for:
 * - Auto-checkpointing (every 3-5 tool calls)
 * - Crash recovery (automatic detection)
 * - Signal monitoring (preemptive crash prevention)
 * - Code analysis (on-demand)
 * - Self-evolution (A/B testing, auto-deployment)
 *
 * Philosophy: Complete invisibility. Zero user intervention.
