# SHIM Competitor Research

**Date:** January 9, 2026  
**Purpose:** Verify naming safety before project initialization

---

## Name Candidates Evaluated

| Name | Risk Level | Conflicts Found |
|------|------------|-----------------|
| LATCH | ⚠️ MEDIUM | LatchBio (biotech), Latch/Ivo (legal AI) |
| SERVO | 🔴 HIGH | Mozilla Servo (web engine), Servo.ai (bot framework), FANUC AI Servo |
| **SHIM** | ✅ LOW | Generic computing term, no active competitors |

---

## SHIM Analysis

### Direct Conflicts: None Active

**Swedish "Shim" Startup (2016)**
- Status: Appears dormant (no news since 2016)
- Domain: Consumer AI companion app (B2C mental health)
- Relevance: Completely different space (B2C vs B2B developer tools)
- Risk: Negligible

### The Name "Shim" in Computing

"Shim" is a generic, well-understood computing term:
- **Definition:** A library that transparently intercepts API calls and adds capability
- **Usage:** Windows Application Compatibility Toolkit, JDBC drivers, polyfills
- **Status:** Public domain concept (like "kernel", "driver", "buffer")

This makes it:
- ✅ Immediately meaningful to developers
- ✅ Describes exactly what the product does
- ✅ Not ownable by any single company
- ✅ Easy to remember and spell

### Trademark Considerations

- Generic computing terms generally cannot be trademarked
- Similar to how "Windows" was allowed but contested
- Product-specific trademark possible: "SHIM for Claude Desktop"

---

## Rejected Alternatives

**LATCH:**
- LatchBio - Active biotech data platform
- Latch/Ivo - Active AI contract review platform (legal tech)
- Risk: Brand confusion in AI space

**SERVO:**
- Mozilla Servo - Famous Rust web rendering engine
- Servo.ai / Servo Labs - Conversational AI framework
- FANUC AI Servo - Industrial servo motor monitoring
- Risk: Strong existing brand recognition in dev community

---

## Domain Availability (Not Checked)

Recommended to check:
- shim.dev
- shimdev.io
- getshim.io
- shim-ai.dev

---

## Recommendation

**SHIM is SAFE to use.**

Reasons:
1. No active competitors with same name in relevant space
2. Generic computing term provides natural defensibility
3. Name accurately describes product function
4. 4 letters, easy to type and remember
5. Fits naming pattern with KERNL and GREGORE (subtle, technical)
